"""PreToolUse shim: pipe the event through a *trusted* harness, never a repo-supplied one.

The policy logic lives in the repo-agent-harness package (one brain); this shim only resolves
*which* harness to ask, in trust order:

1. The repo's own `.mcp.json` entry, **only if it is the canonical sha-pinned uvx form** — an
   explicit, immutable pin (used by opencode/CI or `harness-init --pin`).
2. Otherwise, the plugin's **bundled** harness, resolved from this script's own install location
   (`<plugin_root>/servers/harness-mcp`) — trusted because it is the installed plugin's own code,
   the same harness it runs as the MCP server, and is NOT controlled by the target repo.

This keeps the guard active in a default zero-footprint install (no repo `.mcp.json` required),
while still refusing to execute any repo-supplied command shape: a no-approval hook must never run
arbitrary code a repo could plant.

Fail-open by contract: any error (no git repo, no trusted harness, cold-cache timeout) prints an
empty response and exits 0 — a hook problem never blocks work.
