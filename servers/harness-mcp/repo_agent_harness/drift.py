"""Drift detection between the harness prompt bodies and on-disk SKILL.md copies.

The harness server is the source of truth for the per-repo workflow prompt
bodies. The plugin repo also ships ``skills/<name>/SKILL.md`` files as
offline copies for Claude Code users whose client does not surface MCP
prompts. These two can drift if someone edits one but not the other; the
drift check warns (never errors) when they diverge.

Two layers:

- :func:`compare_bodies` — pure: harness body vs. on-disk body, returns a
  structured result. No I/O.
- :func:`check_repo_drift` — walks ``<root>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`` (the
  plugin's well-known skill directory), compares each to the harness body.
  Reports which prompts are in sync, which have drifted, and which are
  missing entirely.
- :func:`sync_prompts` — the operator tool to refresh the on-disk copies
  to match the harness. Never overwrites by default; pass ``force=True``
  to overwrite even non-drifted files.

Drift is a warning, never an error. The plugin's load-time hook calls
:func:`check_repo_drift` and emits a ``console.warn`` listing drifted
files; the user is expected to refresh via :func:`sync_prompts` when they
want the offline copy updated.
