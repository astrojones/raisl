"""Shared Serena-first gate: one predicate + messages for every code-read path.

Both the PreToolUse hook (native ``Read``) and the harness's own ``repo_read_range``
tool consult this module, so a fresh repo funnels *every* ergonomic whole-file code
read through Serena onboarding. Closing only one path is not enough: an agent that is
denied ``Read`` will reach for ``repo_read_range`` (observed in session 9e6fd520) and
skip onboarding entirely — so onboarding never runs and no ``.serena/memories/`` are
written, leaving future sessions with no persistent project memory.

Symbol navigation (serena_get_symbols_overview / serena_find_symbol) is intentionally
NOT gated here: onboarding itself explores via those tools, so gating them would
deadlock the very step we are trying to compel.

stdlib-only on purpose: the hook imports this on its hot path.
