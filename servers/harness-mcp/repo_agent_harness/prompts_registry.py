"""Per-repo workflow prompts exposed by the harness MCP server.

The bodies in ``prompts/`` are the single source of truth for the workflow
prompts (bugfix, feature, refactor, test, implement, commit) and the
/harness-init workflow. They are exposed via ``@mcp.prompt`` registration so
any MCP-aware assistant that supports ``prompts/list`` discovers them, and
also via the ``repo_prompt_get`` tool wrapper for clients (opencode) that
do not surface raw prompts to the model.

The Claude plugin and the opencode plugin both derive their per-assistant
surfaces from these bodies. Drift is checked at bootstrap time and emitted
as a warning, never an error.

Adding a new prompt:

1. Drop a markdown file at ``prompts/<name>.md`` (no frontmatter needed —
   the body is the prompt).
2. Add the name to ``EXPECTED_PROMPTS`` in ``tests/test_prompts.py``. The
   test enforces the SSOT contract.

The registry is built once at import time; ``register(mcp)`` must be called
from ``server.py`` to attach the prompts to a given FastMCP instance.
