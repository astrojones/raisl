_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
Safe, repo-aware tools for the git repo at the current working directory: repo facts
(repo_* tools) and semantic code navigation (serena_* tools, launched on first use).

**For any task that touches code, your FIRST action is `serena_initial_instructions`** — it
loads the Serena navigation manual and launches the symbol server. Do this before any native
Read/Grep of code, then navigate by symbol. (Skip only for pure non-code chores.)
**If it reports the project is not onboarded, run `serena_onboarding` and complete it** (write
the project memories it asks for) — a one-time per-repo step — before deep work.

- Navigate by symbol: serena_* (find_symbol, find_referencing_symbols, get_symbols_overview)
  for code; repo_search_*/repo_read_range for files. Read precise ranges; never dump whole
  files or recursively read the tree. Native Read/Grep are a fallback ONLY when Serena cannot
  answer (non-code files, not-yet-indexed) — never for code discovery.
- Call repo_context_overview to orient (languages, entrypoints, important paths).
- In Claude Code, to map an unfamiliar or multi-file region dispatch the `explorer`
  subagent — it runs this same serena+harness navigation read-only and returns a cited
  reading list. It is the harness-native replacement for the built-in `Explore` agent;
  prefer it for any code exploration.
- Workflow playbooks (bugfix, feature, refactor, test, implement, commit) are served as
  MCP prompts and via repo_prompt_get(name); the implement pipeline coordinates the
  implementer/reviewer/test-runner subagents.
- Run repo_verify_changed on the files you changed before declaring work done.
- Shell is policy-bounded: destructive commands and secret-file reads are blocked; git
  push and database migrations need confirmation. Check repo_policy_check_command if unsure.
- Connecting writes no harness files into the repo (serena keeps its symbol index under
  `.serena/` on first navigation). Materialization is opt-in: call
  repo_bootstrap to write agent/ (editable policies + health) and an AGENTS.md guide — for
  per-repo customization or non-MCP clients (opencode/CI). If repo_context_overview's
  `harness` block already reports harnessed=true with a guide, read it for repo-specific
  overrides.
