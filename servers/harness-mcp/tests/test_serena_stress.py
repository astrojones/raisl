"""Stress / regression tests for the shared Serena session under parallel-subagent load.

The reported flakiness — "the plugin is flaky when several parallel subagents use Serena,
especially with TypeScript" — has a concrete suspect in :mod:`repo_agent_harness.gateway`:
all subagents in a Claude Code session route through ONE harness process, ONE
``SerenaGateway``, ONE persistent MCP session, ONE child Serena. ``SerenaGateway.call``
invalidates that *shared* session (closing the child + every language server) on ANY
single call's timeout or exception. With concurrent callers, one slow/aborted call tears
the session out from under its siblings — exactly an intermittent, load-dependent failure.

These tests force that interleaving *deterministically* (a flaky test for flakiness is
useless as a release gate) using the LSP-free fake Serena, so the race is exercised by
construction, not by luck. They are expected to FAIL on a gateway that tears the shared
session down on a single call's failure, and to pass once teardown is scoped to genuine
transport death. Each test carries a hard ``timeout`` so a regression fails loudly.
